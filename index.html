    <h1>Privacy Policy for SnapSpence</h1>
    <div class="date"><strong>Effective Date:</strong> February 22, 2026</div>

    <p>
      SnapSpence ("we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy.
      This Privacy Policy explains how your information is collected, used,
      and safeguarded when you use the SnapSpence mobile application.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information Overview</h2>
    <p>
      SnapSpence is designed as an <strong>offline-first</strong> application.
      Your financial data, including income, obligations, savings, and receipt
      images, is stored <strong>locally on your device</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Data Collection and Usage</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Financial Data:</strong> All financial information you enter is
        stored in your device’s private storage (Core Data) and is used solely
        to provide financial tracking, insights, and health scores.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Receipt Images:</strong> Scanned receipt images are stored locally
        on your device.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>AI Insights:</strong> When you use SnapSpence AI features, relevant
        financial snapshots are sent securely to Google Gemini APIs for processing.
        This data is used only for generating real-time insights and is not stored
        by our servers or used for model training or advertising.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Analytics:</strong> We use Firebase Analytics to collect anonymized
        usage data (such as screen views and button interactions) to improve app
        performance and user experience. No personally identifiable or financial
        data is sent to Firebase.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>
      All user data is stored locally on your device and may be included in your
      personal iCloud backup according to standard iOS system settings.
      We do not have access to your financial data or receipt images.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Subscriptions</h2>
    <p>
      Payments and subscription management are handled by Apple and RevenueCat.
      SnapSpence does not collect or store payment details.

      more information.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>
      Because your data is stored locally, you retain full control over it.
      You may delete individual records or uninstall the app at any time to
      permanently remove all associated data.
